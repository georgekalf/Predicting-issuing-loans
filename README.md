## The Business Context
#### A major bank wants to better predict the likelihood of default for its customers, as well as identify the key drivers that determine this likelihood. 
#### They hope that this would inform the bank’s decisions on who to give a credit to and what credit limit to provide, as well as also help the bank have a better understanding of their current and potential customers, which would inform their future strategy, including their planning of offering targeted credit products to their customers.

## The Data
#### The bank collected data on 25 000 of their existing clients. 
#### Of those, 1,000 were randomly selected to participate in a pilot described below. 
#### Data about the remaining 24,000 is in the file “Credit_data.csv”. 
#### The dataset contains various information, including demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements from April to September, as well as information on the outcome: did the customer default or not in October.
